# Bolt âš¡


Bolt is a simple service which serves RTMP packets/streams over the web using HLS and FFMPEG.
 - Bolt can connect to any existing rtmp endpoint and start serving HLS file immediately 
 - It offers API's to interact with the platform and can handle the scaling and redistribution of the streams from single/multiple sources

## How to setup BOLT 

- clone the repository 
- run the bash script present under scripts folder `./scripts/start.sh` which uses docker to run both the rtmp server and BOLT server 
 - refer the API doc to creat Streams
- connect your broadcasting software to the RTMP endpoint ([http://localhost:1935/live](http://localhost:1935/live)) and use the streamKey generated by BOLT
- once the rtmp server successfully starts receiving packets, trigger the start stream endpoint post which BOLT will start generating and serving HLS chunks
 - head over to [http://localhost:3000/api/live/{streamKey}](http://localhost:3000/api/live/%7BstreamKey%7D) to view the live playback.
